Dataset of Malicious Access Requests for Adaptive Access Control Policy Learning 

Two types of malicious access requests targeting Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) include unauthorized access requests stemming from Sybil attacks and interference access requests resulting from Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Specifically, the dataset in 1 minute is considered, ranging from 28860 to 28919. Besides, the pos_x is limited to below 400, which focuses on a main road segment called Routed dâ€™Esch. Trust values, as explored in our previous study (it would be added after publication), are directly employed in this analysis. For access control policy decisions, the default trust value, reflecting accurate trust assessments, is adopted as the basis.
